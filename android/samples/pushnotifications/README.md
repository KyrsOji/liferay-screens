# Push Notifications with Liferay Screens

This example Android app uses [Liferay Screens](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-screens/), the [Push Notification plugin for Android](https://github.com/brunofarache/liferay-push-android) and a [portlet](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-plugins/tree/master/portlets/push-notifications-portlet) to receive push notifications.

For instructions on using push in your apps, see [this tutorial on LDN](https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/using-liferay-push-in-android-apps). There's also a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LjutX0dcRw) that shows you how to create a similar application from scratch.
